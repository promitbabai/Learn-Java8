/**
 * Stream API Terminal Operations
 *      1. collect() - used to return the result of the intermediate operations performed on the stream.
 *      2. forEach() - used to iterate through every element of the stream.
 *      3. reduce()  - reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a single value. The reduce method takes a BinaryOperator as a parameter.
 *
 * Note: Intermediate Operations are running based on the concept of Lazy Evaluation, which ensures that every method returns a fixed value(Terminal operation) before moving to the next method.
