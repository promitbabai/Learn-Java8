/**
 * A Functional Interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method.
 * To designate an interface as a Functional Interface, we donâ€™t need to use the @FunctionalInterface annotation.
 *
 * The @FunctionalInterface annotation prevents abstract methods from being accidentally added to functional interfaces
 * Lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface.
 * A functional interface can have any number of default methods. Runnable, ActionListener, and Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfa
